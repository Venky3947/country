The provided solution outlines a Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to process a CSV file named country_full.csv. This file contains detailed information about countries, including their names, alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes, country codes, regions, and sub-regions. The ETL pipeline is structured to perform the following key tasks:

1. Extract
The CSV file is read into a Pandas DataFrame. This step involves loading the data from the file path specified, ensuring the initial extraction covers all necessary information for further processing.
2. Transform
Data Cleaning: The transformation phase begins with data cleaning, specifically removing any rows that have missing values in critical columns such as name, region, and sub-region. This ensures that the subsequent analysis operates on complete and reliable data.
Data Aggregation: After cleaning, the data is aggregated to count the number of countries within each region. This step simplifies the dataset to a summary level, providing insights into the distribution of countries across different global regions.
3. Load
The processed data, now aggregated by region with counts of countries, is loaded into a SQL database. The table created in the database, countries_per_region, stores the results of this aggregation. This step finalizes the ETL process by persisting the transformed data in a structured format, suitable for querying and analysis.
Key Features of the Solution
Error Handling: The script includes basic error handling mechanisms to manage potential issues that could arise during file reading, data transformation, or database loading. This ensures robustness and reliability of the ETL process.
Database Flexibility: While the example uses SQLite for demonstration purposes, the database connection string can be adjusted to connect to any SQL database, including on-premise SQL servers or cloud databases such as Azure SQL Database or AWS RDS. This makes the solution adaptable to different deployment environments. we should adjust the database connection string as per our specific environment setup.
Scalability and Maintainability: The code is structured in a modular fashion, with separate functions for each phase of the ETL process. This not only makes the script easier to understand and maintain but also allows for scalability. Adjustments or enhancements to the ETL logic can be made within the respective functions without impacting the overall workflow.
The solution is intended to be a starting point, demonstrating how to build a Python-based ETL pipeline for processing CSV data. It highlights key considerations such as data cleaning, transformation through aggregation, and loading data into a database, which are common tasks in data engineering projects.
